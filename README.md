# Visual Studio Code extension

The Snyk Visual Studio Code plugin scans and provides analysis of your code, including open-source dependencies and infrastructure as code configurations. Download the plugin at any time free of charge and use it with any Snyk account. Scan your code early in the development lifecycle to help you pass security reviews and avoid costly fixes later in the development cycle.

Snyk scans for vulnerabilities and returns results with security issues categorized by issue type and severity.

For open source, you receive automated algorithm-based fix suggestions for both direct and transitive dependencies.

Results appear in context, in line with the code in your IDE.

This single plugin provides a Java vulnerability scanner, a custom code vulnerability scanner, and an open-source security scanner.

In using the Visual Studio Code extension, you have the advantage of relying on the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/). You also have available the [Snyk Code AI Engine](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-code#ai-engine).

Snyk scans for the following types of issues:

* [**Open Source Security**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/) - security vulnerabilities and license issues in both direct and indirect (transitive) open-source dependencies pulled into the Snyk Project.\
  See also the [Open Source docs](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-applications/snyk-open-source).
* [**Code Security** ](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/)- security vulnerabilities in your own code. See also the [Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-applications/snyk-code) docs.
* [**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/) - configuration issues in your IaC templates: Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation, and Azure Resource Manager. See also the [IaC](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-infrastructure) docs.
