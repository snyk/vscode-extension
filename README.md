# Visual Studio Code extension

The Snyk Visual Studio Code plugin provides analysis of your code and open source dependencies. Download the plugin at any time free of charge.

Snyk scans for vulnerabilities and returns results with security issues categorized by issue type and severity.

For open-source, you receive automated algorithm-based fix suggestions for both direct and transitive dependencies.

This single plugin provides a Java vulnerability scanner, a custom code vulnerability scanner, and an open-source security scanner.

Snyk scans for the following types of issues:

[**Open Source Security**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/) - security vulnerabilities and license issues in both direct and in-direct (transitive) open-source dependencies pulled into the Snyk Project. See also the [Open Source docs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source).

[**Code Security and Code Quality**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/) - security vulnerabilities and quality issues in your own code. See also the Snyk Code docs (https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code).

The plugin also provides the [**Open Source Advisor**](https://snyk.io/advisor/) to help you find the best package for your next project. Information is provided on the package health of the direct dependencies you are using including popularity, maintenance, risk, and community insights.
